Constraints and how to change your build

[[undeclared_sys_prop_reads]]
=== Reading system properties

Plugins and build scripts should not read system properties directly using the Java APIs. Instead, these system properties should be declared as a potential build input by
using the value supplier APIs.

Before:

```
def enabled = System.getProperty("some-property")
```

After:

```
def enabled = providers.systemProperty("some-property").forUseAtConfigurationTime().present
```
